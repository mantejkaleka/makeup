            <h2>Do i need to have a trial for bridal makeup?</h2>
            <p>
                A trial is recommended for all bridal clients, this will give you the chance to trial your desired
                makeup look and trial the products on your skin.

                A trial will also give you confidence so you can relax on your wedding day knowing the exact result you
                will attain.

                However if you really do not wish to have a trial or it’s not possible, you will not be pressured into
                having one.

            <h2>Can I book you for my whole wedding day?</h2>
            <p>
                Absolutely, I’m often requested to come back before reception for touch ups or change of look. I can
                also attend your photo session or you can request me for the full day to make sure everything stays
                picture perfect.
                Contact me for quotes.

            <h2>Will my makeup last all day?</h2>
            <p>
                I have tried and tested many products and ask many questions to ensure I’m using the right products for
                your skin type and to ensure longevity.
                So long as you don’t touch your face throughout the day your makeup will stay put. The only thing you
                may wish to touch up would be your lips.
